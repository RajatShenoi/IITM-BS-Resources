# IITM BS Data Science Resources

#### Why I made this repository?
I have just joined this course and I didn’t find one place where I can access all the materials. After going through a lot of discourse posts, we keep learning about new resources that IITM BS allows and read comments about people wishing that they knew about it before.

So here I am, hoping to make a complete list of everything available to us. Of course, I joined in the May 2023 batch and won’t have all the info right now. I request the seniors and batch-mates to reply with other links that I might have missed out so that I can edit this post and include that too.

## How to help by adding newer links or updating older ones?
First of all, thanks for doing this. There are 3 ways you could do this:
- **Pull Request (Preffered)**: Please submit a pull request (if familiar with GitHub) after adding or editing a link you might want to add or change. This makes it easy for me to approve the changes and the changes are automatically done without me needing to manually change it.
- **Create an Issue:** Please head on to the [issues](https://github.com/RajatShenoi/IITM-BS-Resources/issues) tab and click on **New Issue**. Enter there the link that you'd want me to add to this repository and I will do it ASAP.
- **Post in Discourse:** To those who don't know, this page was created because I couldn't edit the Original Post on discourse after 24 hours. You can still however, post a link that you'd like to add here and I'll be sure to update this page.
